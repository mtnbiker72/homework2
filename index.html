                <p>
                    Welcome to my homepage! My name is Heather Graham and thanks to the bootcamp program through DU I
                    have made this webpage! I've been in the IT and telecom space for over 25 years. From support to QA
                    to Engineering, I've worked on some of the latest and greatest technologies.
                    <br> <br>
                    Currently I work for Comcast in the innovation wing. We develop applications for business customers
                    and do small trials to judge interest levels. If it's a success, it's moved to other groups to
                    maintain and add additional functionality. I've spend a lot of my career in the VoIP space. My
                    most recent project was to integrate the open-sourced FreeSWITCH application into an Audio
                    Conferencing solution for Comcast Business. It was a challenging project but very exciting to be
                    part of.
                    <br> <br>
                    In addition to work, I enjoy a lot of activies. I love to spend time biking, hiking, skiing,
                    camping, boating - really anything outside! With the pandemic allowing us to work from home, my
                    husband and I have spent several months traveling around the country with our 2 dogs (Finley and
                    Murphy). It was a great expereience that I look forward to doing more of.
